<h1>Human Machine</h1>
<h3>Prologue</h3>
<p>As I stepped through the door of this secret room, it looked as if it hadn't been touched by mankind for centuries. I was expecting to feel a sense of foreboding, but for some strange reason it felt hopeful. A nice, if momentary, reprieve from the last 24 hours. <em>Why are they chasing me?!</em></p>
<p>A strange, blue-green glow was slowly pulsating from behind a giant statue, making it appear as if it were breathing deeply.</p>
<p>The figure standing before me was monstrous. My eyes were immediately drawn upwards to the head with closed eyes. It was probably twice as tall as an average man and made of out granite polished so smoothly that I could nearly see my reflection. Its eyes were closed and with a peaceful look on its face, it almost looked as if it was sleeping.</p>
<p><em>Was this a tomb or some sort of gateway?</em></p>
<p>As I crept closer to inspect the words chiseled onto its stomach, I couldn't help but notice something strangely out of place. There was no dust. It was almost as if I'd stepped into some ancient clean room. My mind raced trying to analyze how something like that could be created naturally but I was shaken from my thoughts almost immediately.</p>
<p>The rhythmically pulsating light began quickening and I could hear a humming begin, like the whir of a thousand tiny motors had sprung to life.</p>
<p>"I woke it up…", sighing softly to myself. I turned around to leave, but the room was a perfectly chiseled circle and the door I came in through had disappeared.</p>
<p>Trapped.</p>
<p>The fit and finish of whomever built this place so long ago was a marvel of precision engineering. Too bad I wouldn't be able to tell anyone about it.</p>
<p>The humming grew louder, the turquoise light pulsating faster and brighter until it became a constant glow. I shielded my eyes as a slight breeze seemed to be circling the 10 foot diameter room.</p>
<p>Then, a sharp chemical twinge crept its way into my nose. At that moment I realized why the room was dust free. The room had cooked it. Whatever the vapor was, if I waited much longer the entire room would be flash-burned. Some centuries old way to detect foreign contaminants and incinerate them. But why?</p>
<p>It didn't matter. If I didn't do something soon, I was toast. Just then a small, red ruby previously hidden inside the statue's navel flashed brightly. It looked like an ancient button, inset just a few inches above the chiseled writing:</p>
<p>FROM WILLPOWER</p>
<p>FLOWS ALLPOWER</p>
<p><em>What does that mean?</em> Was I supposed to push to the button to stop the flow of power or to start it? It seems I could do nothing and hope for things to get better or manifest my own destiny. If I wait, I either get burned alive or they'll find their way in here, just as I had, and do God-knows-what to me. I could only hope this hidden jewel was my fail-safe salvation.</p>
<p>I reached a trepidatious finger out, but paused before touching the ruby, conflicted with self-doubt.</p>
<p><em>No.</em></p>
<p>Then, almost ironically, I mustered the last bit of willpower I had, and drove the jewel home with a singular click.</p>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p>Startled from a dream, I awoke suddenly trying to figure out if I was still dreaming. The bed felt hard and as I brushed my hand against it, I realized I wasn’t in a bed at all, but on something much harder. My joints felt stiff and the air smelled like a mixture of old, dry must, burnt hair, and wood shavings.</p>
<p>As the grogginess began to wear off I realized I couldn’t see anything. “I never have my glasses out of reach…”, thinking to myself as my hands quickly tapped the hard wooden surface I now realized I was laying on. I found the frames with my fingertips, saving them in the same quick motion that nearly knocked them off of whatever I was laying on.</p>
<p>Once I managed to fumble my glasses onto my face, things began to come into focus. A thought crossed my mind that my movements felt arduous and robotic but dismissed them just as quickly due to my overwhelming sense of exhaustion.</p>
<p>My eyes darted around the room, which wasn’t so much of a room made for sleeping, but rather a room made for tinkering. Tools, electronic components, half-sawed wood, and large slabs of granite littered the room haphazardly as if a powerful tornado had ripped through it.</p>
<p>The only thing left hanging on the wall was a slab of the granite, which appeared to be cut from the one on the floor. It was fastened to the wall with huge screws and steel braces. The words chiseled into it were hard to miss, but were too small and the room too dark to read from my vantage point.</p>
<p>The moon, while bright and shining through an enormous hole in the ceiling, didn’t reach the far corner of the room where I was, now hanging my legs off the edge of whatever wooden workbench I realized I had been lying on.</p>
<p>As I scooted off the edge of the table, my legs were too rusty to spring into action and I tripped into a pile of mallets, metal, and rivets with piercing clangs that seemed to never stop. I pushed myself up, flinging the objects at my feet across the room. “Gah, stupid tools, get outta here!” I called.</p>
<p>“Wow,” I thought to myself. “I must have been unconscious for some time, it feels like I’ve been bedridden for decades. And now that I think about it, I can’t remember much of anything from before waking up a moment ago…”</p>
<p>This was troubling.</p>
<p>As I fumbled my way across the room towards the light and the words chiseled with such precision into that shining slab of granite, my eyes began to adjust to the moonlight. But not well enough as I stumbled again, over a fallen chair and small table about half the size of a coffee table. In my mind, my arm sprang up quickly, but the reality was that it happened much slower and I nearly fell face first into the wall. A few inches more and I would have cracked my skull.</p>
<p>As I pushed myself off the wall, I began to raise my head to read what this message said, but as I did something shiny, the moonlight magnified by my glasses, shone brightly into my eyes.</p>
<p>As I tried to rub away the temporary blindness, and I regained my vision, my stomach shot into my throat.</p>
<p>There, in front of me, was my hand, encased entirely in some kind of shiny metal. As my eyes swept up my arm to my shoulder and down my chest, torso and legs, I realized that I was covered entirely in some type of aluminum body suit. Somehow my gut already knew.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a suit. It was a part of me.</p>
<p>My mind raced for an explanation, a memory, something, anything, but there was only fog. I didn’t understand.</p>
<p>How could this have happened? How am I made entirely of metal? Why did this happen? I vaguely remember feelings, not so much memories, but more like the feelings of memories. As if I had lived through a lifetime of habits, but had no recollection of individual moments.</p>
<p>I just didn’t understand.</p>
<p>Then I remembered something. The message on the polished piece of granite.</p>
<p>My eyes darted towards it, searching for answers…</p>
